",1,"To determine the number of distinct shapes of green objects in the matrix, we need to analyze the connected groups of cells with the value 3 (which represents green). Let's examine the matrix carefully:

1. The matrix contains a single, large, irregular green object that spans across multiple rows and columns. This object includes:
   - The entire bottom row (5th row)
   - The right side of the first two rows
   - The middle three cells of the third row
   - The top-left cell
   - The single cell in the middle of the fourth row

2. All green cells (3s) in the matrix are connected either horizontally, vertically, or both. This means they form a single continuous shape.

3. The cell in the top-left corner (position [0,0]) is connected to the cell below it (position [1,0]).

4. The seemingly isolated cell in the fourth row (position [3,2]) is actually connected to the cells above and below it (positions [2,2] and [4,2]).

Since all green cells are interconnected, they form a single, complex shape. There are no isolated green cells or separate green objects in this matrix.

Therefore, there is only 1 distinct shape of green object in the matrix.",3
